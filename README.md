How's it going? I'm Gareth, Lead Engineer at [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/) üê∂ and a huge [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) nerd.

### What I'm Up To

I'm currently working on [some study material](https://github.com/garethsaxby/terraform-associate-study-guide) for the [HashiCorp Terraform Associate certfication](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate) to pull together extra material to hit the exam specificaiton.

Beyond that, I'm mostly looking into Kubernetes and GitHub actions, which I'll have more to share about soon!
